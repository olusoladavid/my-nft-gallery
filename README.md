# MyNFTGallery

MyNFTGallery is a simple React app that allows you to view all of your NFTs in one place. The app is currently deployed at [https://my-nft-gallery.netlify.app](https://my-nft-gallery.netlify.app) for you to try out.

## Running the app locally

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/my-nft-gallery.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
    ```
    cd my-nft-gallery
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
4. Start the app:
    ```
    yarn start
    ```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Features

- To view your NFTs, simply navigate to the app and connect your wallet. Your NFTs will then be displayed in gallery style below the navigation bar.
- You can also send an NFT you own to another address
- Clicking the card will take you to the Etherscan page of the token for further information about it
- Simulation Mode: If you don't own any NFTs, you can click the simulation mode (see navigation bar) to view NFTs of a random NFT degen wallet
- In simulation mode, hovering the card will show a "Buy" button that allows you to make a bid on OpenSea
